# Compatibility with DeArrow

If you use the [DeArrow](https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow) extension alongside YouTube No Translation, both extensions may try to modify video titles, which can cause conflicts.

**Recommended DeArrow settings for best compatibility:**
- Enable **"Only format user-submitted titles"**.
- **Do not** enable **"Remove Emojis"**.

If you do not apply these settings, DeArrow will replace titles that may be translated, and they will be ignored by YNT.

Please note: with these settings, the formatting features of DeArrow will only apply to user-submitted titles. For all other titles, YouTube No Translation will ensure the original (non-translated) version is displayed, but without additional formatting from DeArrow. If you prefer DeArrow's formatting on all titles, you will need to disable the "Titles" feature in YouTube No Translation, but this will also disable translation prevention for video titles. No further compatibility improvements with DeArrow are planned.
