# Translation Guide for YouTube No Translation

This document explains how to contribute translations for the extension and its store descriptions.
We welcome translations to make YouTube No Translation accessible to users worldwide! The extension uses the WebExtension internationalization (i18n) system.

### How to Add a Translation

1. **Create a new locale folder**
   
   Navigate to the `_locales` directory and create a new folder with the appropriate locale code:
   ```bash
   mkdir _locales/fr  # For French
   mkdir _locales/es  # For Spanish
   mkdir _locales/de  # For German
   # etc.
   ```
   
   Use the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language.

2. **Copy the English template**
   
   Copy the English `messages.json` file as your starting point:
   ```bash
   cp _locales/en/messages.json _locales/YOUR_LOCALE/messages.json
   ```

3. **Translate the messages**
   
   Open your new `messages.json` file and translate **only** the `"message"` values. Keep the keys and structure unchanged:
   
   ```json
   {
     "extensionName": {
       "message": "YouTube No Translation",  // ← Translate this
       "description": "Name of the extension"  // ← Leave this in English (it's for context)
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Important notes**
   
   - **Do not translate**: JSON keys, `"description"` fields, or placeholder names
   - **Keep placeholders**: If a message contains `$PLACEHOLDER$`, keep it as-is in your translation
   - **Maintain formatting**: Preserve line breaks and punctuation where meaningful
   - **Test your translation**: Build the extension and verify your translation appears correctly

5. **Submit your translation**
   
   Create a pull request with your new locale folder. Make sure to:
   - Test the extension with your locale
   - Update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) in the `[Unreleased]` section under `Added`
   - Mention which language you've added

### Example Translation

English (`_locales/en/messages.json`):
```json
{
  "popup_originalTitles": {
    "message": "Original Titles",
    "description": "Title for original titles feature"
  }
}
```

French (`_locales/fr/messages.json`):
```json
{
  "popup_originalTitles": {
    "message": "Titres originaux",
    "description": "Title for original titles feature"
  }
}
```
